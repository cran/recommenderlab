### NOTES:
# - The implementation is a basic implementation of the algorithm, for a fixed (chosen) number of iterations and without parallellization.
# - Speed is slower than your other algorithms, but it seems workable.
# - The actual model construction actually only happens when you call "predict".  This is a disadvantage of the ALS algorithm, where you actually can only train the model once you have data about the test users.
# - When you set verbose = TRUE, you will see the converge of the error function printed.
# - The algorithm allows low rmse errors on test data .  For topN predictions, the calculated TPRs are lower than for the POPULAR algorithm though. It seems that in this case, topN movies that are not in the test set (not seen) are marked as false positives. ALS will then  recommend  movies that are not often seen, but where similar people gave good ratings.  While marking NAs as false positives is a reasonable way to handle NAs, it perhaps might be interesting to also provide the option to simply ignore NAs in that calculation.
